# rd_syncrr - WIP

## Docker

You can start the project with docker using this command:

```bash
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . up --build
```

If you want to develop in docker with autoreload add `-f deploy/docker-compose.dev.yml` to your docker command.
Like this:

```bash
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml -f deploy/docker-compose.dev.yml --project-directory . up --build
```

This command exposes the web application on port 8000, mounts current directory and enables autoreload.

But you have to rebuild image every time you modify `poetry.lock` or `pyproject.toml` with this command:

```bash
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . build
```

## Configuration

This application can be configured with environment variables.

You can create `.env` file in the root directory and place all
environment variables here.
